# These are blocking outbound traffic, but for firewalls, you are often blocking input traffic instead
# None of these rules are going to stick and will be erased when we reboot the server
# You still have to add --permanent to firewall-cmd or load the nft or iptables file on boot

# Check to see if port 80 outbound is blocked and it is not:
curl portquiz.net:80

# Add a firewall to block port 80 with firewall-cmd on RedHat or Alma Linux
# This is how to add a more complicated rule for firewall-cmd (BUT IT MIGHT BREAK your simple firewall)
firewall-cmd --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter OUTPUT 0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport=80 -j DROP

# Check to see if port 80 outbound is blocked and notice how it fails to connect now:
curl portquiz.net:80

# Notice it doesn't show up because it is a complicated rule
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all

# Notice how it also adds it to iptables - this command shows the iptables rules
sudo iptables -L 

# Notice how it also adds it to nftables - this command shows the nftables rules
sudo nft list ruleset 

# Let’s delete it using iptables
sudo iptables -F  

# Notice how it removed it from iptables
sudo iptables -L

# Notice how it removed it also from nftables
sudo nft list ruleset 

# Check to see if port 80 outbound is blocked and notice how it works now:
curl portquiz.net:80

# Now we want to reload firewall-cmd so that it gets the update that we removed the rule from iptables
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Add a firewall to block port 80 with iptables on RedHat or Alma Linux
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

# Check to see if port 80 outbound is blocked and notice how it fails to connect now:
curl portquiz.net:80

# Notice how it also adds it to iptables - this command shows the iptables rules
sudo iptables -L 

# Notice how it also adds it to nftables - this command shows the nftables rules
sudo nft list ruleset 

# Let’s delete it using iptables or you could have deleted it with nftables
sudo iptables -F  

# Add a firewall to block port 80 with nftables on RedHat or Alma Linux
sudo nft add rule ip filter OUTPUT tcp dport 80 counter drop

# Let’s delete it using nftables
sudo nft flush table ip filter

# Convert an iptables rule to an nth one (the flush/delete one)
sudo iptables-translate -F

# Convert an iptables rule to nft
sudo iptables-translate -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

# Save all the iptables rules to a file, but we still need to load it somewhere on boot
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules

# Put this in a boot script or network config file to load the rules on the system booting up
iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules
